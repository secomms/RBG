================================================================
The purpose of this source file is to demonstrate a readable and compact
implementation of all the Keccak instances approved in the FIPS 202 standard,
including the hash functions and the extendable-output functions (XOFs).

We focused on clarity and on source-code compactness,
rather than on the performance.

The advantages of this implementation are:
    + The source code is compact, after removing the comments, that is. :-)
    + There are no tables with arbitrary constants.
    + For clarity, the comments link the operations to the specifications using
        the same notation as much as possible.
    + There is no restriction in cryptographic features. In particular,
        the SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 XOFs can produce any output length.
    + The code does not use much RAM, as all operations are done in place.

The drawbacks of this implementation are:
    - There is no message queue. The whole message must be ready in a buffer.
    - It is not optimized for performance.

The implementation is even simpler on a little endian platform. Just define the
LITTLE_ENDIAN symbol in that case.

/**
  * Function to compute the Keccak[r, c] sponge function over a given input.
  * @param  rate            The value of the rate r.
  * @param  capacity        The value of the capacity c.
  * @param  input           Pointer to the input message.
  * @param  inputByteLen    The number of input bytes provided in the input message.
  * @param  delimitedSuffix Bits that will be automatically appended to the end
  *                         of the input message, as in domain separation.
  *                         This is a byte containing from 0 to 7 bits
  *                         These <i>n</i> bits must be in the least significant bit positions
  *                         and must be delimited with a bit 1 at position <i>n</i>
  *                         (counting from 0=LSB to 7=MSB) and followed by bits 0
  *                         from position <i>n</i>+1 to position 7.
  *                         Some examples:
  *                             - If no bits are to be appended, then @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x01.
  *                             - If the 2-bit sequence 0,1 is to be appended (as for SHA3-*), @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x06.
  *                             - If the 4-bit sequence 1,1,1,1 is to be appended (as for SHAKE*), @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x1F.
  *                             - If the 7-bit sequence 1,1,0,1,0,0,0 is to be absorbed, @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x8B.
  * @param  output          Pointer to the buffer where to store the output.
  * @param  outputByteLen   The number of output bytes desired.
  * @pre    One must have r+c=1600 and the rate a multiple of 8 bits in this implementation.
